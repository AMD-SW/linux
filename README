Linux kernel
============

AMD version
-----------

This is a branch used by AMD projects using RyzenAI XDNA accelerator
like https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie

This is a stable Linux version with some patches for IOMMU SVA support
and a bug fix for AMD PMC about sleep state.

The kernels are provided as branches pointing to some versions, like
v6.8.7-iommu-sva-part4-v7.

If you are just interested by always having the latest kernel, the
v6.8-iommu-sva-part4-v7 branch points to the latest 6.8.x branch from
this repository.

For the bug fix for AMD PMC about sleep state, there are also the
branches per kernel version, such as v6.8.7-iommu-sva-part4-v7+pmc-10ms-delay

If you are just interested by always having the latest kernel with
this bug fix, the v6.8-iommu-sva-part4-v7+pmc-10ms-delay branch points
to the latest 6.8.x branch with the fix from this repository.

To compile this kernel in a nutshell:
git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.8-iommu-sva-part4-v7 git@github.com:AMD-SW/linux
cd linux
# Often people compile a kernel from source code by reusing
# their current config with something like:
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` <your_build_dir>/.config
# But if you do not have a `.config` file modern enough to start with,
# you can get one for Debian/Ubuntu with:
wget https://gist.github.com/keryell/55c57d5f0280de8943fb8cca64059764/raw/27fdbb7c86060ec58d8470fe391d2cd633f6e89f/.config
# To compile and make some Debian/Ubuntu packages:
make -j `nproc` bindeb-pkg
# Install the kernel. The exact names will depend on your configuration
sudo apt reinstall ../linux-headers-6.8.7+iommu-sva-part4-v7+_6.8.7-00095-gef3f1f49a69d-1_amd64.deb ../linux-image-6.8.7+iommu-sva-part4-v7+_6.8.7-00095-gef3f1f49a69d-1_amd64.deb ../linux-libc-dev_6.8.7-00095-gef3f1f49a69d-1_amd64.deb
```


Generic README
--------------

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
